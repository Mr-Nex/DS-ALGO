~ Matrix Exponentiation

When the problem consists of a recursive relation and the target is to find some desired state (nth value), then Matrix Exponentiation comes in handy.
The goal is to create a component matrix M which will lead us to the desired state from a set of already known states.

Say, we already know K states of a relation and we want to find the (K+1)th state,

Now, we have to create two things-
one is a vector A of size (Kx1) using the known states, another is our component matrix of size (KxK).

With the help of above two, our goal is to create B of (Kx1) size, which will contain the set of next states.
i.e.,                   [M x A = B]

=>                 M    x   | f(n) |    =   | f(n+1) |
                            |f(n-1)|        |  f(n)  |
                            |  ..  |        |   ..   |
                            |  ..  |        |   ..   |
                            |f(n-k)|        |f(n-k+1)|
                            
Now, all we need is to design M,
